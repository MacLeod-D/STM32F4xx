There is a silent revolution:
The MCUs of today are so mighty. They will change our world within some years !

Small ESP8266 are VERY cheap today. ESP32 impresses with 2 indepentent cores.
Now I ordered 2 boards from China:

1) STM32F103 (bluepill) for amazing 1.79€ (including porto)
2) STM32F407 (blackboard) for       7.79€
